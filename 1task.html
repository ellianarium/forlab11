<h2> How to make stylish everyday makeup step by step? Follow the instructions: </h2>
<ol> 
	<li type="I"><em>Cleanse your skin of impurities, makeup, sweat and more.</em> To do this, use a special wash gel, micellar water or a cleansing toner.</li>
	<li type="I"><em>Prepare your skin for cosmetic applications.</em> To do this, use a moisturizer. To better absorb the cream and invigorate the skin, apply the cream using the Asian technique - with light pats.</li>
	<li type="I"><em>After the cream has been absorbed, go about applying a foundation.</em> Use a primer to even out your skin tone. If there is redness, pimples and other blemishes, use a concealer.</li>
	<li type="I"><em>Apply some blush to the cheekbones with a wide brush and blend them towards the temples.</em></li>
	<li type="I"><em>Accentuate the eyes.</em> Choose a light makeup without arrows. For a deeper look, apply a beige, silvery cream, or champagne shade to the lids. With brown shadows, bring the lower eyelid along the lash line. Use black or brown mascara for a wide-eyed look.</li>
	<li type="I"><em>Shine your lips.</em> An ideal choice is a glossy lip gloss in pink, peach, beige.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Nude makeup is natural and invisible. To give the skin a radiance, experts recommend using tinting agents with the addition of microscopic sparkling particles.</h3>
